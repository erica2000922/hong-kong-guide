                            Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special
                            Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
                            China, is a city and special administrative region
                            of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South
                            China. With 7.5 million residents of various
                            nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre territory,
                            Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated
                            places in the world. Hong Kong is also a major
                            global financial centre and one of the most
                            developed cities in the world.

                            Hong Kong was established as a colony of the British
                            Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island
                            from Xin’an County at the end of the First Opium War
                            in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to
                            the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium
                            War and was further extended when Britain obtained a
                            99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.British
                            Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941
                            to 1945 during World War II; British administration
                            resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole
                            territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one
                            of China’s two special administrative regions (the
                            other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate
                            governing and economic systems from that of mainland
                            China under the principle of “one country, two
                            systems”.

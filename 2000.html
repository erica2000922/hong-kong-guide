                                After the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong
                                faced a series of problems, both political and
                                economical. The government carried out a series
                                of reforms to adopt a more modern ideology and
                                democracy, but faced many difficulties. Despite
                                a transfer of power to China, the citizens
                                participate in how their government is run, and
                                the region maintains some degree of autonomy.
                                Media in Hong Kong has not come under state
                                control, though many citizens believe the media
                                practices self-censorship. The economy would
                                also begin the period with a rise in
                                unemployment rate from 2.2% in 1997 to 4.4% in
                                2000, and 7.9% in 2003. The economy had
                                gradually recovered since 2004 and the overall
                                unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in 2008, however
                                the overall figure rose again to 5.4% in 2009
                                due to the global economic downturn in the last
                                quarter of 2008.
